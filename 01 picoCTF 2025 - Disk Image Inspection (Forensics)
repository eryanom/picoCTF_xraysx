# **picoCTF 2025 - Disk Image Inspection (Forensics)**

Category:    Forensics
Date    :    11 October 2025
Difficulty:  Easy


## Challenge Overview

The challange provides a compressed file named 'disko-1.d.gz'.
my goal is to inspect and analyse it to recover a hidden flag - without f


## Stage 1 - Verify the File Type

Start by identifying what kind of file i'm dealing with:

file disko-1.d.gz

Output:

disko-1.d.gz: gzip compressed data, was "disko-1.d"


## Stage 2 - Inspect Without Full Extraction

Instead of decompressing the entire image, we can stream its contents and search directly for readable strings.
This saves time and avoids creating unnecessary files.

zcat disko-1.d.gz | strings | grep picoCTF


Why this works:
The file is gzip-compressed, but the flag text is stored in plain ASCII inside the image.
zcat decompresses the data stream on the fly, and strings extracts human-readable text, while grep filters for the CTF flag pattern.


Result

Running the command reveals a string matching the CTF flag format:

picoCTF{REDACTED}



Flag redacted to comply with CTF rules.
